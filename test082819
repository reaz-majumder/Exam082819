What is compile time and run time?
ans - Runtime and compile time are programming terms that refer to different stages of software
program development. Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered
is converted to executable while Run-time is the instance where the executable is running.

What is heap?
ans - The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays
is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
ans - The JVM loads the code, verifies the code, executes the code, manages memory (this
includes allocating memory from the Operating System (OS), managing Java allocation
including heap compaction and removal of garbage objects) and finally provides the runtime
environment.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
ans - The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes
are mutable.

What is Singleton class?
ans - In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one
object (an instance of the class) at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
ans - Serialization and Deserialization in Java with Example. Serialization is a mechanism
of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse
process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
ans - Integer.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
ans - The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
ans - Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another
constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
ans - A serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for
the GC operation, while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
ans- JIT stands for Just In time compilation and JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
ans - Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts
up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full,
garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are
cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
ans - No.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
ans - The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store
local variables and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.
Variables stored in stacks are only visible to the owner Thread while objects created
in the heap are visible to all thread.
